// Logical Operators:
// && is the AND operator in JavaScript and with this, you can combine 2 logical values.
// || is the OR operator
// ! is the NOT operator

const hasDriversLicense = true;
const hasGoodVision = false;

console.log(hasDriversLicense && hasGoodVision); // true and true will return true; true and false will return false
console.log(hasDriversLicense || hasGoodVision); // only one has to be true for the entire operation to be true
console.log(!hasDriversLicense); // basically just switches from its original true value to not true which will return false

if (hasDriversLicense && hasGoodVision) {
  console.log("Sarah is able to drive!");
} else {
  console.log("Someone else should drive...");
}
// this will return false and the the else block will be executed
